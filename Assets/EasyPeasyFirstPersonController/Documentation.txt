INSPECTOR SETTINGS
You can customize the FirstPersonController in the Inspector. Default values work well for most cases:
- Movement Settings:
  - Walk Speed: 3 (walking speed)
  - Sprint Speed: 5 (sprinting speed)
  - Crouch Speed: 1.5 (crouching speed)
  - Air Control: 0.3 (air movement control)
- Ability Settings:
  - Can Jump: Enabled (toggle jumping)
  - Can Sprint: Enabled (toggle sprinting)
  - Can Crouch: Enabled (toggle crouching)
  - Can Slide: Enabled (toggle sliding)
- Crouch Settings:
  - Crouch Height: 1 (crouch character height)
  - Crouch Camera Height: 0.5 (crouch camera height)
- Slide Settings:
  - Slide Speed: 9 (slide speed)
  - Slide Duration: 0.7 (slide duration, seconds)
  - Slide Fov Boost: 5 (FOV increase during slide)
  - Slide Tilt Angle: 5 (camera tilt angle)
- Jump Settings:
  - Jump Height: 1.5 (jump height)
  - Coyote Time Enabled: Enabled (allows edge jumping)
  - Coyote Time Duration: 0.2 (edge jump window, seconds)
- HeadBob Settings:
  - Bob Amount: 0.1 (head bob amplitude)
  - Bob Speed: 2 (head bob speed)
- Camera Settings:
  - Mouse Sensitivity: 25 (mouse look sensitivity)
  - Snappiness: 100 (mouse smoothing)
  - Normal Fov: 60 (default field of view)
  - Sprint Fov: 70 (sprint field of view)
  - Fov Change Speed: 5 (FOV transition speed)
- Physics Settings:
  - Gravity: -9.81 (gravity force)
  - Ground Distance: 0.1 (ground check distance)
  - Ground Mask: Ground layer

CUSTOMIZATION
- Increase Sprint Speed (e.g., 7) for faster running.
- Adjust Jump Height (e.g., 2) for higher jumps.
- Set Bob Amount to 0 to disable head bobbing.
- Change Mouse Sensitivity for faster/slower camera movement.
- Extend Slide Duration (e.g., 1) for longer slides.

TROUBLESHOOTING
- Jumping not working?
  - Ensure Gravity is -9.81.
  - Check GroundCheck position: X=0, Y=-0.9, Z=0.
  - Verify Ground Mask includes the ground layer.
- No movement?
  - Is the CharacterController enabled?
  - Are WASD keys blocked by another system (e.g., UI)?
- Camera issues?
  - Confirm Player Camera and Camera Parent are assigned.
  - Check Camera position: X=0, Y=0, Z=0.
  - Check CameraParent position: X=0, Y=1, Z=0.
- Sliding not working?
  - Is Can Slide enabled?
  - Press Left Control while sprinting.
- Errors on play?
  - Check if Ground Check, Player Camera, or Camera Parent are missing.
  - Assign them in the Inspector.

TESTING
1. Start the game.
2. Try the controls:
   - WASD: You should move.
   - Space: You should jump about 1.5 units.
   - Left Shift: You should sprint, with FOV increasing to 70.
   - Left Control: You should crouch, reducing height to 1.
   - Left Control while sprinting: You should slide, speed reaching 9.
3. Test in the Inspector:
   - Set Jump Height to 3, jump higher.
   - Disable Can Sprint, sprinting should stop.
   - Set Bob Amount to 0.2, head bobbing should increase.
   - Change Gravity to -15, you should fall faster.

NOTES
- Keep Ground Distance small (0.1) for efficient physics.
- If issues persist, double-check the hierarchy and Inspector settings.
